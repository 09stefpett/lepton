Lepton is a tool to shrink JPEGs an average of 22% losslessly.


This can be used to archive large photo collections, or to serve images live and save 22% banwdith.

Usage:

./lepton original.jpg compressed.lep
./lepton compressed.lep restored_original.jpg

Or all at once:

./lepton original.jpg compressed.lep && ./lepton compressed.lep restored_original.jpg && diff restored_original.jpg original.jpg && echo no differences


Lepton may also be used with pipes -- be sure to check the exit code when using pipes
as if lepton determines that an image is not compressible with the lepton algorithm
then it will produce 0 bytes and return a nonzero exit code (failure). In this case
do not assume the 0 byte file is representative of the original.

./lepton - < original.jpg > compressed.lep
./lepton - < compressed.lep > restored_original.jpg


You may specify higher memory limits than the default for lepton to handle bigger images

./lepton -memory=1024M -threadmemory=128M input_file output_file

Additionally you can configure lepton to be allowed to process progressive jpegs.
Warning: these take more memory to decode than normal JPEGs since the entire framebuffer
must be kept in memory for the duration of the decompression, instead if just 2 rows of blocks.

./lepton -allowprogressive -memory=1024M -threadmemory=128M progressive.jpg compressedprogressive.lep
